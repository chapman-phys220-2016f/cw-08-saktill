# PHYS220 CW 8

**Author(s):** _\<Will and Sakthi\>_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-08-saktill.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys220-2016f/cw-08-saktill)

**Due date:** 2016/10/25

## Specification

This week, you will explore the differences between ```python/numpy``` and the up-and-coming scientific programming language ```julia```. The syntax of ```julia``` is heavily inspired by a combination between ```python``` and ```MATLAB```, which we will also explore.

1. Work through the [Julia Overview Slides](http://slides.com/profdressel/julia-overview/). Create the appropriate notebooks and test functions as you follow along. Discuss and ask questions.
1. In a ```julia``` interpreter, run the command ```Pkg.generate("juliapkg","MIT")```. This generates a complete ```git``` repository with a template for a new ```julia``` package. Explore the created directory and its contents: explain in a notebook exactly what is created, and how it relates to what we have been learning in class.

## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

I (Will) would say I had fun with Julia Sets. Julia as a program is pretty neat to use. I think I'll personally be sticking to Python for familiarity reasons, but I can see how Julia may end up being a primary language.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

Will and Sakthi
